What `shiny` is and why it can by usefull for actuary
----------------
> Interact. Analyse. Communicate.

In data science or actuary world you are always trying to view on the data based on different angle to find the most significant insight.

During your data analysis you might come to the point there is so many options to view on the data your code might become too messy or even it is not possible to __hard__ code all options.

For such a case `shiny` might come quite handy as it provides very interactive way to serve all options you desire __in real time__ as well as presentation tool for your data story.

Perfect thing is you need only R for building this interactive framework.
