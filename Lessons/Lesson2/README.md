# Objective
To learn what is a Loss Ratio and what are different forms of projections of losses (average, chain ladder/bf, loss ratio walk)

# Content
1) [Start from absolute numbers](Support/L2_losses_and_expenses.md) (losses and expenses) (10min)
2) [Introduction to loss and expense ratios](Support/L2_loss_and_expense_ratios.md) (20 min)
3) [Have a look at data](Support/data_prep_exercise_KPI.md) (Look for underperformers) (60 min)

#### Feedback (3 min)

Go to `https://www.surveymonkey.co.uk/r/KS3SD7M` and please answer the questions as they really help us to improve the course.

#### Homework (~30 min) [2b / 4b]
1) Find out, which __year__ was the __most terrific__ for portfolio you have identified as __most profitable__ during the lesson and show it on the chart using `ggplot2` package. Write an explanation about your findings into the code as comment. __Commit__ it to your repository into `Lessons/Lesson2/Homework`.

2) Implement UWR chart into Class Shiny app (`Lessons/Lesson2/Shiny`). 
Edit file server.R at `output$lesson2_KPI_multidim_UWR_graph` with predefined input data and implement UWR chart we learned during lesson2 as dynamic view not only for `Unit`. Do not forget to commit your changes.
