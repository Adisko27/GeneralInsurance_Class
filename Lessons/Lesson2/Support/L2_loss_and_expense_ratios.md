# Introduction to loss and expense ratios

## Loss ratio
In the previous section we looked at the absolute amounts of expenses and claim costs in our data. That helps us to understand how much were our total expenses that are directly or indirectly linked to our insurance business.
Now the next step is the performance. It is obvious that it can happen that there are two portfolios with different size but with the same amount of losses. Which one performed better? And so here comes the term of loss ratio. Loss ratio is comparison of volume of claim costs and volume of net earned premium per specified segment.
In the previously mentioned case, the portfolio that is performing better when compared from the perspective of losses is the one that has lower loss ratio.

## Expense ratio
Just like in the previous case, there are situations we want to know which of two differently sized portfolios performs better in terms of expenses. And again, thatâ€™s the place where the expense ratio is introduced. It is a ratio of total expenses and total net earned premium per specific segment.
